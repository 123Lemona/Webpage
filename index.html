                <i>The first ever telephone</i> came to be in 1876 from the telegraph. Before the telephone, there was the telegraph and then the radio came to be. The telegraph allowed people to communicate over long distances. From trying to improve the telegraph, the telephone came into being.  With the development of the telephone, many people wanted to be on the telephone’s system. The government had nationalized the telephone lines for communication during World War 1. Many people loved the telephone and all the positive things it could do and bring. This also led people to speculate about the possible negatives the telephone could bring. People knew that the telephone could help with job opportunities, allow people to socialize more, bring people closer together like never before, and lead to an advanced form of transmission of intelligence. The major negative factor that the telephone provided was privacy. Since you had to leave your home and travel to the store or different places to make a phone call. Homes weren’t wired together, and it wasn’t safe to have to go somewhere else to call someone or receive a call. Even though this was a major downside, many people still knew the future possibilities the telephone could provide. They would have never thought that today in age, cell phones and other types of technology have helped us tremendously in our lives. It has also made us distance ourselves from people since we can contact them from a screen. It hasn’t brought us closer together in the way that people have thought, and instead brought us further apart.

               <i>The first portable telephone</i> came out in 1983 and was something that was new and easy to access for everyone. Instead of having the phone on the wall or in your car and being limited to a certain spot, they came up with the idea of being able to communicate without the need to just be at home or in your car. <i>The first portable telephone</i> came in the shape of the Motorola KynaTAC 8000X. It weighed just under a kilogram, stood 33cm high, stored 30 numbers, took 10 hours to charge,and offered 30 minutes of talk time. It cost about $4,000, which would be about $10,000 in today’s currency, and it was a sign of important significance because of the time and price. The next phone upgrade was the Motorola Microtac 9800X was considered as <i>the first portable phone</i>i because it was lighter in weight and could actually fit in people’s pockets. It was released in 1989 and could show more information and wasn’t as chunky as its predecessors. It costs between $2,495 and $3,495. The next upgrade came out in 1992 and was called the Motorola International 3200 and Nokia 1011. They were both small in size from their predecessors and had more space to hold more numbers and a longer call time. These are all of the phones that were simple in design and were used to make calls long distances before any type of game features were invented. This was just the beginning.

                Phones were still being upgraded in their size and weight. People wanted a small phone that could fit inside of their pockets and hands comfortably. The Motorola Startac was the first clamshell cellular phone and one of the first to have a display screen in 1996. It was the first flip phone and cost $1,000. The Nokia 8110 was also released in 1996 and had 4GB of storage, faster service, and a better protection policy. It was the first Nokia high-end 8000 series of phones. It had a sliding cover that protected the keypad and was the first Nokia phone with monochrome graphic LCD. It was featured in the Matrix movie and became a big hit. Then the Siemens S10 was our <i>first look at color</i>that came out in 1997 brought the mobile phone display with four different colors. It was the first phone that had the option of adding color to the screen. You could send and receive emails and the phone would also vibrate to alert you of a message. Hagenuk launched the GlobalHandy that was the first phone that didn’t have an external aerial. New themes with different color options were also starting to appear onthe market for customers. There were swappable keyboards that you could switch to with a different color. Nokia also launched a range of interchangeable covers in the following year for the 5100 series of phones. This made it the first time that cell phones could also be fashion orientated. This became very popular with the general public.

                The Nolia 7650 was released in 2002 and was the first phone in Europe that had a built-in camera. This was the first <i>ew feature</i> and big news since you could also capture moments and people without having to buy a camera. The Sony Ericsson P800 was also released in the same year. Instead of just having a built-in camera, it was also touchscreen. It was small, sleek, and light blue in color, and it came with the same color stylus pen to navigate the screen. In 2003, the Nokia N-Gage was released in response to the advance in the Game Boys. It was very popular because it allowed you to play games like a game boy, but it declined because of how chunky and thick it was. The Palmone Treo 600 was released in the same year and was a merge between a PDA, camera, and phone that made this phone popular until Blackberries. The phone was like a PDA in which you could put all of your contacts and their information. The Blackberry Quark 6210 was similar in functionality and design, but it was more intergraded. In 2004, the Soney Ericsson P910 was a flip smartphone that had full and complete access to the internet. Then the Nokia 6630 gave access to global roaming. It allowed people to connect and contact people from around the world and not just in their country. In 2005, HTC Universal was the first 3G Pocket PC phone at HTC that had the functionality of windows mobile. The phones have a better access to the internet and functionality as they continue to upgrade.

                Phones have now become so advanced and all we think about. Phones are divided by two different brands from two different companies that people compare all the time. We have Apple that released different types of iPhones, and Android with their Samsung phones. The two are compared for their camera quality and their functionality in general. Phones now have games that we can download, access to our email without a computer, a place to store notes, listen to music, watch movies and videos, and so much more. We can access just about anything on the internet and do whatever. We can order, pay, and access the menu at restaurants. We have a voice generator in our phone to help us do things. We can read books on our phones and create different types of art, from drawings to music. Phones and technology have come a long way that our phones are like a <i>life companion</i> because of how long we have been with them, and how we don’t wish to part with them. We are constantly upgrading our phones with the latest camera quality and the bigger the size. We want more cameras and better quality. We can even have the weather app on our phones and the latest news. Instead of TVs or human contact, most people turn to their phones. It’s interesting how we come out with different iPhones and Samsung phones to give us new features to make our lives better, but it can bring us further apart if everything we are able to do is on our phones and we don’t have to go out to do certain things for it.
